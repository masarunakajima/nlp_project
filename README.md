## Scope of this work

- Train Stupid Backoff model for next word prediction.
- Evaluate the accuracy as well as time and memory requirement for the prediction model.

## What I found

The next word prediction using ngram model with stupid backoff method  
is a quick way to make a next-word prediction model.
